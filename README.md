# STM32 NUCLEO-F767ZI USB CDC Example

It finally connects to Host and provides Virtual COM port (for `User USB` connector on Nucleo board).

* red LED D3 lights on fatal error
* blue LED D2 is blinking (to signal that CPU is running)
* The CDC Transmit/Receive are currently No-operation (planned
  control of green LED D1 in near future).


WARNING! The Code Generated by `CubeMX 5.3.0` is buggy (at least
for firmware `STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.15.0`) - you must
apply this fix to generated code:

Also in my case I need to replace:
* `__packed="__attribute__((__packed__))"`
with
* `__packed="__attribute__((packed))"`
to avoid build errors (in C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU GCC
Compiler -> Preprocessor).

NOTE: To avoid problems please use this directory structure:
* `/home/ansible/projects/stm32-usb-cdc1/` - path of this project
* `/home/ansible/STM32Cube/Repository/STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.15.0/` - path
  of firmware package `STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.15.0`
